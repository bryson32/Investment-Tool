# Investment-Tool
Investment analysis tool that generates extensive data into a csv file.
Only works on a specific format of CSV file. Program is highly customizable. You can change a lot of parameters in the py script to test a multitude of different scenarios. Thought it was cool so I threw it on here because why not.
Main use was to compare IUL and S&P, parsing data from the specific structure shown in the included csv file. Might turn this into a more customizable app with a UI + more flexibility (comparing more than just historical S&P to simulated IUL windows). Maybe one day...

Made for my IB friend Grace
